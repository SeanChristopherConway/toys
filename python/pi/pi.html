            width="163" height="164" BORDER="0">What is pi (the symbol is the small Greek
      letter <img SRC="pi0.gif" alt="pi" width="16" height="15" BORDER="0">)? It is
      equal to C/d, or C/2r, where C is the circumference of any circle, and d is its
      diameter, and r is its radius.</p>
    <p> Euclid proved that this ratio (C/d) is always the same, no matter the
      size of the circle. What he did was inscribe similar regular polygons in any
      two circles. Then, he increased the number of sides of the inscribed regular
      polygons. He reasoned that as the number of sides increased, the perimeter of
      the inscribed polygon gets closer and closer to the circumference of the
      circle. He also showed that the perimeters of the similar polygons were
      proportional to the radii of the circles in which they were inscribed. And so,
      C is proportional to r, in other words C/r is a constant. By convention,
      <b>pi=C/2r</b>. And we can use that as our definition of pi.</p>

    <p><b>Value of pi:</b></p>
    <p> Archimedes approximated pi, by inscribing and circumscribing a circle
      with polygons of many sides. He showed that 3+10/71&lt;pi&lt;3+1/7 (in other
      words, 3.1408450704225 . . . &lt; pi &lt; 3.142857142857142857 . . . ). Now, pi
      is approximated by computers, using infinite series.</p>

    <p>One of my mathematics teachers (in High School, as I recall) told us
      that pi was exactly 22/7 (3+1/7), which is 3.142857142857142857 . . . Notice
      that it repeats every six digits. It is not bad (three digits of accuracy), but
      certainly not exact. By the way, the square root of 10 is fairly close to pi:
      3.162277660168... (only two digits of accuracy). Using sqr() as the square root
      function, sqr(3)+sqr(2)=3.146264369942 . . . (about three digits of accuracy).
      Fiddling around with ratios, I found that 20/9 times the square root of 2 is
      3.142696805274... (three digits of accuracy), which is slightly closer than
      22/7. Much closer is 355/113, which is 3.141592920354 . . . (seven digits of
      accuracy). Kochansky's approximation is sqrt(40/3-2sqrt(3)), which is
      3.141533... (about four digits of accuracy).</p> <hr>
    <p><b>Area of a circle:</b></p>
    <p><img SRC="pi1.gif" alt="area of a circle" ALIGN="LEFT" width="163"
            height="164" BORDER="0">At the top of this article, I said that Euclid proved
      that C/2r is a constant. C/2r eventually became known as pi, and is our
      definition of pi. We need to figure out the area of a circle.</p>
    <p>Let's say that we approximate a circle with a regular polygon of n
      sides. This diagram shows three of those sides, with length P/n (where P is the
      perimeter of the polygon). And I have drawn a triangle by drawing two of the
      radii. The area of this triangle is approximately Pr/2n (the altitude is close
      to r), and as the number of sides of our polygon increases, the area of the
      triangle gets closer and closer to Cr/2n. In other words, the altitude of the
      triangle gets closer and closer to r, and the perimeter of the polygon gets
      closer and closer to the circumference of the circle. There are n of these
      triangles filling up the circle. So the area of the circle is about
      A=nCr/2n=Cr/2. Our definition of pi was <b>C=2(pi)r</b>. Substituting this for
      C, we get <b>A=(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b>. So we now know where these two famous
      equations come from.</p>

      <p>Area formula: <b>A=(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b></p> </BLOCKQUOTE> <hr>
    <p><b>Addendum #1 (comments):</b></p>
    <p> I hear that the dimensions of the Great Pyramid (of Khufu, also known
      as Cheops) show that the ancient Egyptians knew the value of pi. Those people
      who measure the dimensions of pyramids claim tremendous accuracy, much more
      accuracy than the rough exterior of a pyramid warrants. So, when they say that
      the Great Pyramid exhibits the value pi, to many decimal places, a person
      should be skeptical. But, it is also not very remarkable that the ancient
      Egyptians might have used pi in this pyramid. It seems that the base (much of
      it is missing) of the pyramid is within a few inches of being square, and is
      just a few minutes of arc from being aligned with true north, very accurate
      indeed.</p>
    <p>By the way, there are many pyramids, and each has a different slope. So,
      the Great Pyramid is the only one with just those dimensions and ratios. There
      is also evidence that the ancient Egyptians preferred a steeper slope than that
      of the Great Pyramid, but had to settle for shallower slopes, to keep the
      pyramids from collapsing.</p>
    <p>The ancient Egyptians seem to have sometimes used a value of 22/7 for
      pi. There is also evidence that they estimated the area of a circle with a
      square with a side that is 8/9 the size of the circle's diameter. This gives a
      value of pi of 3.16049382716 . . .</p>
    <p>See <A href="../pseudo/pyramid.htm">Pi and the Great Pyramid</A>.</p>
    <p>Any fool can figure that the value of pi is a little greater than 3, if
      he/she wants to experiment a little. Draw a circle, the larger the better, and
      measure the diameter and the circumference (with a string perhaps). Calculate
      pi=C/2r. You will probably get 3 or 4 digits of accuracy. If you are really
      good at that sort of thing, you may be able to get 5 digits. That's pretty
      good. That's better than Archimedes. Try that for a simple low-tech science
      fair project.</p> <hr>
    <p><b>Addendum #2 (trigonometric series):</b></p>
    <p> Here are a couple of series which can be used to approximate pi:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - . . .</p>
      <p>pi<sup>2</sup>/12=1 - 1/4 + 1/9 - 1/16 + 1/25 - . . .</p>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>The first one converges to pi/4 very slowly. The second one is quite a
      bit faster. There are much better series than these. The first one evidently
      comes from this series (use x=1):</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>arctan(x)=x - x<sup>3</sup>/3 + x<sup>5</sup>/5 - x<sup>7</sup>/7 +
        x<sup>9</sup>/9 - . . .</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>The arctangent of x is in radians. Here are some more series:</p>

    <p><b>Addendum #3 (comments):</b></p>
    <p>If you have similar triangles (they have the same shape), their areas
      are equal to some common ratio <b>s</b> times one of the sides (or other part,
      like an angle bisector) squared. The same thing is true of quadrilaterals and
      other polygons. In the case of squares, which are all similar to each other,
      <b>s</b> is 1, the area of a square is the side squared. In the case of a
      circle (all circles are similar), when the part in question is the radius, then
      <b>s</b> is pi.</p>
    <p>An interesting attempt to estimate pi is this: Drop a needle onto a
      paper with equally spaced lines on it. Keep track of how many times the needle
      touches a line, and how many times it does not touch a line. Pi=2L/Pd, where L
      is the length of the needle, d is the distance between lines, and P is the
      probability of touching a line. <b>P</b> is estimated by <b>hits/tries</b>,
      tries is the number of times you dropped the needle, and hits are how many
      times the needle touched a line. This method is inefficient. Thousands of tries
      will result in only about 4 digits of accuracy. In 1901, Lazzerini (I do not
      know his first name) used this method to calculate pi to 6 decimal places,
      using only 3408 tosses of a needle, a result that sounds to most mathematicians
      like cheating.</p> <hr>

    <p><img SRC="pi3.gif" alt="tall thin rectangles" ALIGN="LEFT" width="153"
            height="79" BORDER="0">In Calculus, we may estimate pi by estimating the area
      of a semicircle. Here we will use a radius of 1. We know the equation of this
      semicircle: x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>=1, or y=sqrt(1-x<sup>2</sup>), where
      sqrt() is the square root function. We estimate the area on a computer, using
      thin rectangles, which have width <b>delta x</b> (a small increment of
      <b>x</b>) and height <b>y</b>. We will choose <b>x</b> to be half-way between
      the left and right sides of each tall rectangle (this gives us a closer fit
      between the semicircle and the many rectangles). We will get the area, which we
      already know is (pi)r<sup>2</sup>/2 (because it is a semicircle). Since r=1,
      our sum should be pi/2. So, to estimate pi, I will double our sum. I'll just
      run the program, and report the results:</p>

      <p><b>Question: Can you figure out what is strange about my
          method?</b></p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Answer: My calculator converts the angle to radians, and then uses
      several terms of an infinite series to estimate the sine. Here is my equation
      in radians: pi=(pi sin a)/a. We are using pi to estimate pi.
      Pi=3.14159265358979 is hard coded into my calculator. We are using pi with 15
      digits of accuracy to estimate pi to 13 digits of accuracy. That is fairly
      foolish.</p> <hr>
    <p>Here is a sleazy fraction which seems to be close to pi:
      10471975511/3333333333. This is 3.141592653614 . . ., a remarkable 11 digits of
      accuracy. OK, I confess. All I did was find the fraction that is the repeating
      decimal 3.1415926536 1415926536 14 . . ., and reduce it to its lowest terms.
    </p>
    <p>Here is another: 10000000000/3183098862=3.141592653429... That is 9
      digits of accuracy. I cheated again. I used pi to figure out the
      denominator.</p> <hr>
    <p><b>Addendum #5 (a complicated series):</b></p>
    <p>There are many series for estimating pi. One of the best (fastest
      converging) is:</p>
    <p><img SRC="pi4.gif" alt="complicated series" width="565" height="58"
            BORDER="0"></p>
    <p>which gives about 14 more digits of accuracy for every new term. It was
      discovered by D. &amp; G. Chudnovsky in 1987. Series like this are probably the
      ones used by the super computers. Srinivasa Ramanujan was apparently a pioneer
      in creating several of these complicated, and rapidly converging series.</p>
    <p>Alternating series (the terms alternate between positive and negative),
      like this one and the first two series above, are handier to use, because they
      automatically give a simple estimate of the error. The true value is always
      somewhere between the last sum and the next to last sum.</p>

    <p><b>Addendum #6 (Indiana bill):</b></p>
    <p>In 1897, the Indiana State House of Representatives passed a bill (House
      Bill 246) supposedly setting the value of pi. The bill was defeated in the
      Senate, despite support from the State Superintendent of Education. It was
      written by Edward J. Goodwin (who was offering his mathematical results to the
      State of Indiana, "free of charge"), and introduced by Representative Taylor I.
      Record. According to David Singmaster, in the <I>Mathematical
        Intelligencer</I>, the bill was actually ambiguous, and seemed to say that pi
      is equal to the following values:</p>

      following is a rough approximation of his method. In the diagram on the left, I
      have drawn one side (with length x) of a polygon inscribed in a circle with

      What is y in terms of x? Application of <A href="pythag.htm">The Pythagorean
        Theorem</A>, leads to y=sqrt(1/2-sqrt(1-x)/2). If we start with a hexagon, then
      x=1/2, and pi is approximated by 6x. I will then use a computer to calculate y,
      producing a dodecagon (12-gon). Pi is then approximated by 12y. Then y becomes
      my next x, and I can double the number of sides again, approximating pi with
      24y. Archimedes was satisfied with a 96-gon. In the following table, I went on

    <p>I started losing accuracy after that. I assume that the available square
      root function is not particularly accurate (about 10 digits). Archimedes not
      only inscribed a polygon, but he also circumscribed a similar polygon. That
      would give an upper and lower bound on the answer. So he would know about how
      accurate he was. But, he didn't have algebra and a computer. So, he stopped at
      a 96-gon (and his work is difficult to follow without algebra). We and
      Archimedes started with a hexagon. We could have started with a square, which
      wouldn't have been any more difficult.</p> <hr>
    <p><b>Addendum #8 (science fair project):</b></p>
    <p><img SRC="pi6.gif" alt="estimating pi by hand" width="511"
            height="511"></p>
    <p>Here I have drawn a quarter circle on a 50x50 grid. With a side of 50,
      the area of the quarter circle should be pi(2500)/4 or 625pi. I have colored
      the squares that are at least halfway within the quarter circle. My estimate of
      pi should be the number of blue squares divided by 625. That is 1965/625 or
      3.144. That is 3 digits of accuracy, almost as good as Archimedes. It was not
      very tedious counting the 1965 blue squares, as I didn't have to count every
      square: the bottom 7 rows are all 50, then next 5 rows are 49, etc. A finer
      grid, and a larger circle should give us more accuracy.</p>
    <p>This method may make a good <b>Science Fair Project</b>. Carefully draw
      a quarter circle on a very large sheet of graph paper. Probably tape your paper
      to a smooth floor. You probably want to make the paper small enough so that it
      will fit in a typical science fair display. But a really huge sheet of paper,
      with photographs to document just how large it is, would also be nice. Then add
      some text explaining how you did it (maybe with photographs showing the steps).
      And display your estimate of pi. Keep records of your arithmetic, and check it
      several times. If you miss a row, you will be disappointed with the results.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to use a grid like the above, is to connect the diagonals of
      various rectangles, and estimate pi with a length instead of an area. This
      should give you a little more accurate results. But it takes a lot more
      arithmetic, as there are square roots everywhere.</p> <hr>

    <p><b>Addendum #10 (more trig):</b></p>
    <p>Above, I said the formula pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ... came from
      this series for the arctangent (inverse tangent) of x:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>arctan(x)=x - x<sup>3</sup>/3 + x<sup>5</sup>/5 - x<sup>7</sup>/7 +
        x<sup>9</sup>/9 - ...</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Well, this arctan series is also used in other (harder to derive)
      formulas for pi:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>pi=20 arctan(1/7) + 8 arctan(3/79)</p>
      <p>pi=4 arctan(1/2) + 4 arctan(1/5) + 4 arctan(1/8)</p>
      <p>pi=16 arctan(1/5) - 4 arctan(1/239)</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Just use the arctan series to evaluate arctan(1/2), and arctan(1/5),
      etc. These happen to converge much more rapidly than the pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 -
      1/7 + 1/9 - ... series. Normally, these are given as producing pi/4. I just
      multiplied by 4. There are other formulas involving arctangents and pi.</p>

    <p><b>Addendum #11 (the Borweins &amp; Ramanujan):</b></p>
    <p>Jonathan and Peter Borwein (at one time holders of the world record for
      most digits of pi) give the following computer algorithms for calculating pi
      (which I modified slightly). In both methods, <b>a</b> approaches 1/pi (* is
      multiplication, ^2 is squared, sqr(2) is the square root of 2):</p>
    <p>Method A:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>start: n=0; y=1/sqr(2); a=1/2;<BR> repeat: n=n+1;
        y=(1-sqr(1-y^2))/(1+sqr(1-y^2)); a=(a*(1+y)^2)-y*2^(n+1);</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Method B (really efficient):</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>start: n=0; y=sqr(2)-1; a=6-4*sqr(2);<BR> repeat: {n=n+1;
        y=(1-sqr(sqr(1-y^4)))/(1+sqr(sqr(1-y^4)));<BR>
        a=(a*(1+y)^4)-y*(1+y+y^2)*2^(2*n+3)};</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Of course, instead of y^2, use y*y, which is way faster. Also, after a
      few iterations, you will need to do your own multiple precision arithmetic.
      Method A gives 19 digits of accuracy after four iterations. Method B gives 694
      digits of accuracy after only four iterations. The Borweins say that it may be
      the most efficient known algorithm for calculating pi. It has been used to set
      several world records.</p>

      places. He says that this has all been verified by a retired mathematics
      professor and a computer. Above (addendum #4), I use integral calculus to

      a semicircle. Let's do that again:</p>

    <p>This time, while estimating pi, I have deduced lower and upper bounds on
      pi (much as Archimedes did). All of this could be done by hand, except that it
      would be very tedious to sum 100,000,000 small rectangles. So the process is
      not at all mysterious. I used an actual circle of radius 1. The area of each
      rectangle can be found to any accuracy needed. In each of the narrowest
      rectangles, the width is 0.00000001 and the height is calculated using the
      pythagorean theorem. Again, this can be calculated to any accuracy needed (as
      it is an exact formula). The lower bound is found by making the rectangles all
      fit within the unit semicircle. The upper bound is found by making the upper
      side just fit outside the unit semicircle (so the circle is inside the
      collection of rectangles).</p>
    <p> Here, I got fifteen digits of accuracy (which is the most accuracy that
      I can get out of this particular square root function). We can assume that the
      last digit may be somewhat inaccurate. I could print out a few square roots to
      verify this; but I won't. In the last row, we find that pi is between
      3.14159263358948 and 3.14159267358948. The value of pi given by Mr. Spencer,
      3.14868804..., is not in that range. That should convince anyone that his
      contention is false. No matter where he got his formula, it has nothing to do
      with circumferences or areas of circles.</p>
    <p>These formulas are the work of Mr. Spencer:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>pi=3z=C/d<BR> C=xy<sup>7</sup>z<sup>2</sup><BR>
        d=xy<sup>7</sup>z/3<BR> C=10!<BR> x=4<BR> y=7<BR> z=360/7<sup>3</sup><BR>
        pi=3628800/1152480=3.14868804...</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>He still contends that his "pi" is correct, and furthermore is rational
      (3628800/1152480 which reduces to 1080/343). A rational number is an integer
      divided by an integer (see <A href="../algebra/irration.htm">Irrational
        Numbers</A>).</p>
    <p>All this is a mystery to me. His pi is not pi. Euclid proved that C/d is
      the same for all circles. There are many ways to measure pi, using real circles
      (equations of circles), to any desired accuracy. Above, I have proved, using a
      real circle, that pi is within a fairly narrow range, and 3.14868804 . . . is
      not in that range.</p> <hr>
    <p>Of course, Mr. Spencer is still not convinced. Here is a little history
      about pi:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p> Archimedes conjectured (guessed) that pi is irrational. In 1761 (said
        to be 1766 in some books), Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that pi is
        irrational. And his proof is apparently very difficult. I have not seen the
        proof. Legendre proved it in 1794. In 1947, Ivan Niven proved it fairly easily.
        That proof is described in <I>Proofs from THE Book</I> (by M. Aigner and G.
        Ziegler) as "an elegant one-page proof that needs only elementary calculus." It
        also requires a couple more pages of proofs of preliminary theorems. Further
        results from that proof are that pi squared is irrational, and that e^r is
        irrational for every rational r not equal to zero. It has further been shown,
        by Lindemann in 1882, that pi is transcendental number (in other words, it is
        not the root of any polynomial equation with integer coefficients). The proof
        of that is apparently very difficult indeed.</p> </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Above, Mr. Spencer gives z as pi/3. In email, he asks why people think
      that z is transcendental. Of course, no one has heard of z. They claim that pi
      is transcendental, which would mean that Mr. Spencer's z is also
      transcendental, <b>if the equation z=pi/3 were true</b>. Let's forget about
      "transcendental," as that is a difficult concept, and deal with "irrational."
      Pi is irrational. Therefore, z must be irrational, if z=pi/3 is true. Above, we
      see these equations:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> C=xy<sup>7</sup>z<sup>2</sup><BR> d=xy<sup>7</sup>z/3<BR>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Mr. Spencer chooses C=10! (ten factorial). And he defines x=4 and y=7.
      Then he solves the first equation for z and finds that 3z=3.14868804 . . . and
      is rational. The second equation is not necessary, except to balance the 3z=C/d
      equation. Well, 3z is not pi, as I proved above. I actually proved that pi is
      between 3.14159263358948 and 3.14159267358948. 3z (3.14868804 . . .) is not
      equal to pi.</p><hr>
    <p>Mr. Spencer is still trying to convince me. I sent him this rather
      sarcastic (but accurate, in my opinion) summary of what he has done:</p>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p>We want "pi" to be 1080/343 (or 3x360/7<sup>3</sup> or 3.14868804 . .
        .) and not 3.1415926535 . . . Then we choose an integer (10! or 3628800) with
        lots of factors as the circumference C of our circle. For no good reason, we
        will define a z="pi"/3 and we find that 10!=(4)(7<sup>7</sup>)(z<sup>2</sup>).
        We used 7<sup>7</sup> to cancel out the 7's in the denominator of
        z<sup>2</sup>, since 7 is only a factor of 10! once. And who knows why we chose
        z<sup>2</sup> instead of z? There is no pi<sup>2</sup> in C=(pi)d. Solving for
        z, we find that it is (surprise!) 360/343. And therefore (surprise!)
        "pi"=3.14868804 . . .</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>I told him that the above <b>IS</b> my understanding of his methods. He
      didn't seem to like the tone of the above. Anyway, this is all algebraic
      fiddling and has nothing whatsoever to do with a circle. We threw in 360 just

    <p><img SRC="pi10.gif" alt="area" ALIGN="LEFT" width="657" height="175"
            BORDER="0">On the far left we see a number of concentric circles, the largest
      of which has a radius of <b>r</b>. To the right of that, we see each of the
      circles unrolled into straight lines filling a right triangle. We know that the
      right end of each line is in a straight line because its length is proportional
      to its original radius. It would seem that the triangle has the same area as
      the circle. This may be obvious or it may not be obvious. We can probably prove
      it using limits. Anyway, we see that the area of the triangle is
      <b>(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b>. This is a fairly popular proof of the area
      formula.</p> <HR NOSHADE="NOSHADE">
