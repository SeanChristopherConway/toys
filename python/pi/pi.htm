		WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0">What is pi (the symbol is the small Greek
		letter <IMG SRC="pi0.gif" ALT="pi" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0">)? It is
		equal to C/d, or C/2r, where C is the circumference of any circle, and d is its
		diameter, and r is its radius.</P> 
	 <P> Euclid proved that this ratio (C/d) is always the same, no matter the
		size of the circle. What he did was inscribe similar regular polygons in any
		two circles. Then, he increased the number of sides of the inscribed regular
		polygons. He reasoned that as the number of sides increased, the perimeter of
		the inscribed polygon gets closer and closer to the circumference of the
		circle. He also showed that the perimeters of the similar polygons were
		proportional to the radii of the circles in which they were inscribed. And so,
		C is proportional to r, in other words C/r is a constant. By convention,
		<B>pi=C/2r</B>. And we can use that as our definition of pi.</P>

		with polygons of many sides. He showed that 3+10/71&lt;pi&lt;3+1/7 (in other

	 <P>One of my mathematics teachers (in High School, as I recall) told us
		that pi was exactly 22/7 (3+1/7), which is 3.142857142857142857 . . . Notice
		that it repeats every six digits. It is not bad (three digits of accuracy), but
		certainly not exact. By the way, the square root of 10 is fairly close to pi:
		3.162277660168... (only two digits of accuracy). Using sqr() as the square root
		function, sqr(3)+sqr(2)=3.146264369942 . . . (about three digits of accuracy).
		Fiddling around with ratios, I found that 20/9 times the square root of 2 is
		3.142696805274... (three digits of accuracy), which is slightly closer than
		22/7. Much closer is 355/113, which is 3.141592920354 . . . (seven digits of
		accuracy). Kochansky's approximation is sqrt(40/3-2sqrt(3)), which is
		3.141533... (about four digits of accuracy).</P> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Area of a circle:</B></P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="pi1.gif" ALT="area of a circle" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="163"
		HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0">At the top of this article, I said that Euclid proved
		that C/2r is a constant. C/2r eventually became known as pi, and is our
		definition of pi. We need to figure out the area of a circle.</P> 
	 <P>Let's say that we approximate a circle with a regular polygon of n
		sides. This diagram shows three of those sides, with length P/n (where P is the
		perimeter of the polygon). And I have drawn a triangle by drawing two of the
		radii. The area of this triangle is approximately Pr/2n (the altitude is close
		to r), and as the number of sides of our polygon increases, the area of the
		triangle gets closer and closer to Cr/2n. In other words, the altitude of the
		triangle gets closer and closer to r, and the perimeter of the polygon gets
		closer and closer to the circumference of the circle. There are n of these
		triangles filling up the circle. So the area of the circle is about
		A=nCr/2n=Cr/2. Our definition of pi was <B>C=2(pi)r</B>. Substituting this for
		C, we get <B>A=(pi)r<SUP>2</SUP></B>. So we now know where these two famous
		equations come from.</P>

		<P>Area formula: <B>A=(pi)r<SUP>2</SUP></B></P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #1 (comments):</B></P> 
	 <P> I hear that the dimensions of the Great Pyramid (of Khufu, also known
		as Cheops) show that the ancient Egyptians knew the value of pi. Those people
		who measure the dimensions of pyramids claim tremendous accuracy, much more
		accuracy than the rough exterior of a pyramid warrants. So, when they say that
		the Great Pyramid exhibits the value pi, to many decimal places, a person
		should be skeptical. But, it is also not very remarkable that the ancient
		Egyptians might have used pi in this pyramid. It seems that the base (much of
		it is missing) of the pyramid is within a few inches of being square, and is
		just a few minutes of arc from being aligned with true north, very accurate
		indeed.</P> 
	 <P>By the way, there are many pyramids, and each has a different slope. So,
		the Great Pyramid is the only one with just those dimensions and ratios. There
		is also evidence that the ancient Egyptians preferred a steeper slope than that
		of the Great Pyramid, but had to settle for shallower slopes, to keep the
		pyramids from collapsing.</P> 
	 <P>The ancient Egyptians seem to have sometimes used a value of 22/7 for
		pi. There is also evidence that they estimated the area of a circle with a
		square with a side that is 8/9 the size of the circle's diameter. This gives a
		value of pi of 3.16049382716 . . .</P> 
	 <P>See <A HREF="../pseudo/pyramid.htm">Pi and the Great Pyramid</A>.</P> 
	 <P>Any fool can figure that the value of pi is a little greater than 3, if
		he/she wants to experiment a little. Draw a circle, the larger the better, and
		measure the diameter and the circumference (with a string perhaps). Calculate
		pi=C/2r. You will probably get 3 or 4 digits of accuracy. If you are really
		good at that sort of thing, you may be able to get 5 digits. That's pretty
		good. That's better than Archimedes. Try that for a simple low-tech science
		fair project.</P> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #2 (trigonometric series):</B></P> 
	 <P> Here are a couple of series which can be used to approximate pi:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - . . .</P> 
		<P>pi<SUP>2</SUP>/12=1 - 1/4 + 1/9 - 1/16 + 1/25 - . . .</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>The first one converges to pi/4 very slowly. The second one is quite a
		bit faster. There are much better series than these. The first one evidently
		comes from this series (use x=1):</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>arctan(x)=x - x<SUP>3</SUP>/3 + x<SUP>5</SUP>/5 - x<SUP>7</SUP>/7 +
		  x<SUP>9</SUP>/9 - . . .</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>The arctangent of x is in radians. Here are some more series:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>pi<SUP>2</SUP>/6=1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + . . .</P>

	 <P>Let's try each of these series for 1000 terms, on my computer. Here are

	 <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #3 (comments):</B></P> 
	 <P>If you have similar triangles (they have the same shape), their areas
		are equal to some common ratio <B>s</B> times one of the sides (or other part,
		like an angle bisector) squared. The same thing is true of quadrilaterals and
		other polygons. In the case of squares, which are all similar to each other,
		<B>s</B> is 1, the area of a square is the side squared. In the case of a
		circle (all circles are similar), when the part in question is the radius, then
		<B>s</B> is pi.</P> 
	 <P>An interesting attempt to estimate pi is this: Drop a needle onto a
		paper with equally spaced lines on it. Keep track of how many times the needle
		touches a line, and how many times it does not touch a line. Pi=2L/Pd, where L
		is the length of the needle, d is the distance between lines, and P is the
		probability of touching a line. <B>P</B> is estimated by <B>hits/tries</B>,
		tries is the number of times you dropped the needle, and hits are how many
		times the needle touched a line. This method is inefficient. Thousands of tries
		will result in only about 4 digits of accuracy. In 1901, Lazzerini (I do not
		know his first name) used this method to calculate pi to 6 decimal places,
		using only 3408 tosses of a needle, a result that sounds to most mathematicians
		like cheating.</P> <HR>

	 <P><IMG SRC="pi3.gif" ALT="tall thin rectangles" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="153"
		HEIGHT="79" BORDER="0">In Calculus, we may estimate pi by estimating the area
		of a semicircle. Here we will use a radius of 1. We know the equation of this
		semicircle: x<SUP>2</SUP>+y<SUP>2</SUP>=1, or y=sqrt(1-x<SUP>2</SUP>), where
		sqrt() is the square root function. We estimate the area on a computer, using
		thin rectangles, which have width <B>delta x</B> (a small increment of
		<B>x</B>) and height <B>y</B>. We will choose <B>x</B> to be half-way between
		the left and right sides of each tall rectangle (this gives us a closer fit
		between the semicircle and the many rectangles). We will get the area, which we
		already know is (pi)r<SUP>2</SUP>/2 (because it is a semicircle). Since r=1,
		our sum should be pi/2. So, to estimate pi, I will double our sum. I'll just
		run the program, and report the results:</P>

		<P><B>Question: Can you figure out what is strange about my
		  method?</B></P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Answer: My calculator converts the angle to radians, and then uses
		several terms of an infinite series to estimate the sine. Here is my equation
		in radians: pi=(pi sin a)/a. We are using pi to estimate pi.
		Pi=3.14159265358979 is hard coded into my calculator. We are using pi with 15
		digits of accuracy to estimate pi to 13 digits of accuracy. That is fairly
		foolish.</P> <HR> 
	 <P>Here is a sleazy fraction which seems to be close to pi:
		10471975511/3333333333. This is 3.141592653614 . . ., a remarkable 11 digits of
		accuracy. OK, I confess. All I did was find the fraction that is the repeating
		decimal 3.1415926536 1415926536 14 . . ., and reduce it to its lowest terms.
		</P> 
	 <P>Here is another: 10000000000/3183098862=3.141592653429... That is 9
		digits of accuracy. I cheated again. I used pi to figure out the
		denominator.</P> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #5 (a complicated series):</B></P> 
	 <P>There are many series for estimating pi. One of the best (fastest
		converging) is:</P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="pi4.gif" ALT="complicated series" WIDTH="565" HEIGHT="58"
		BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P>which gives about 14 more digits of accuracy for every new term. It was
		discovered by D. &amp; G. Chudnovsky in 1987. Series like this are probably the
		ones used by the super computers. Srinivasa Ramanujan was apparently a pioneer
		in creating several of these complicated, and rapidly converging series.</P> 
	 <P>Alternating series (the terms alternate between positive and negative),
		like this one and the first two series above, are handier to use, because they
		automatically give a simple estimate of the error. The true value is always
		somewhere between the last sum and the next to last sum.</P>

	 <P><B>Addendum #6 (Indiana bill):</B></P> 
	 <P>In 1897, the Indiana State House of Representatives passed a bill (House
		Bill 246) supposedly setting the value of pi. The bill was defeated in the
		Senate, despite support from the State Superintendent of Education. It was
		written by Edward J. Goodwin (who was offering his mathematical results to the
		State of Indiana, "free of charge"), and introduced by Representative Taylor I.
		Record. According to David Singmaster, in the <I>Mathematical
		Intelligencer</I>, the bill was actually ambiguous, and seemed to say that pi
		is equal to the following values:</P>

		What is y in terms of x? Application of <A HREF="pythag.htm">The Pythagorean
		Theorem</A>, leads to y=sqrt(1/2-sqrt(1-x)/2). If we start with a hexagon, then

		producing a dodecagon (12-gon). Pi is then approximated by 12y. Then y becomes
		my next x, and I can double the number of sides again, approximating pi with
		24y. Archimedes was satisfied with a 96-gon. In the following table, I went on

		only inscribed a polygon, but he also circumscribed a similar polygon. That
		would give an upper and lower bound on the answer. So he would know about how
		accurate he was. But, he didn't have algebra and a computer. So, he stopped at

	 <P><B>Addendum #8 (science fair project):</B></P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="pi6.gif" ALT="estimating pi by hand" WIDTH="511"
		HEIGHT="511"></P> 
	 <P>Here I have drawn a quarter circle on a 50x50 grid. With a side of 50,
		the area of the quarter circle should be pi(2500)/4 or 625pi. I have colored
		the squares that are at least halfway within the quarter circle. My estimate of
		pi should be the number of blue squares divided by 625. That is 1965/625 or
		3.144. That is 3 digits of accuracy, almost as good as Archimedes. It was not
		very tedious counting the 1965 blue squares, as I didn't have to count every
		square: the bottom 7 rows are all 50, then next 5 rows are 49, etc. A finer
		grid, and a larger circle should give us more accuracy.</P> 
	 <P>This method may make a good <B>Science Fair Project</B>. Carefully draw
		a quarter circle on a very large sheet of graph paper. Probably tape your paper
		to a smooth floor. You probably want to make the paper small enough so that it
		will fit in a typical science fair display. But a really huge sheet of paper,
		with photographs to document just how large it is, would also be nice. Then add
		some text explaining how you did it (maybe with photographs showing the steps).
		And display your estimate of pi. Keep records of your arithmetic, and check it
		several times. If you miss a row, you will be disappointed with the results.
		</P> 
	 <P>Another way to use a grid like the above, is to connect the diagonals of
		various rectangles, and estimate pi with a length instead of an area. This
		should give you a little more accurate results. But it takes a lot more
		arithmetic, as there are square roots everywhere.</P> <HR>

	 <P><B>Addendum #10 (more trig):</B></P> 
	 <P>Above, I said the formula pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ... came from
		this series for the arctangent (inverse tangent) of x:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>arctan(x)=x - x<SUP>3</SUP>/3 + x<SUP>5</SUP>/5 - x<SUP>7</SUP>/7 +
		  x<SUP>9</SUP>/9 - ...</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Well, this arctan series is also used in other (harder to derive)
		formulas for pi:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>pi=20 arctan(1/7) + 8 arctan(3/79)</P> 
		<P>pi=4 arctan(1/2) + 4 arctan(1/5) + 4 arctan(1/8)</P> 
		<P>pi=16 arctan(1/5) - 4 arctan(1/239)</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Just use the arctan series to evaluate arctan(1/2), and arctan(1/5),
		etc. These happen to converge much more rapidly than the pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 -
		1/7 + 1/9 - ... series. Normally, these are given as producing pi/4. I just
		multiplied by 4. There are other formulas involving arctangents and pi.</P>
	 <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #11 (the Borweins &amp; Ramanujan):</B></P> 
	 <P>Jonathan and Peter Borwein (at one time holders of the world record for
		most digits of pi) give the following computer algorithms for calculating pi
		(which I modified slightly). In both methods, <B>a</B> approaches 1/pi (* is
		multiplication, ^2 is squared, sqr(2) is the square root of 2):</P> 
	 <P>Method A:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>start: n=0; y=1/sqr(2); a=1/2;<BR> repeat: n=n+1;
		  y=(1-sqr(1-y^2))/(1+sqr(1-y^2)); a=(a*(1+y)^2)-y*2^(n+1);</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Method B (really efficient):</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>start: n=0; y=sqr(2)-1; a=6-4*sqr(2);<BR> repeat: {n=n+1;
		  y=(1-sqr(sqr(1-y^4)))/(1+sqr(sqr(1-y^4)));<BR>
		  a=(a*(1+y)^4)-y*(1+y+y^2)*2^(2*n+3)};</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Of course, instead of y^2, use y*y, which is way faster. Also, after a
		few iterations, you will need to do your own multiple precision arithmetic.
		Method A gives 19 digits of accuracy after four iterations. Method B gives 694
		digits of accuracy after only four iterations. The Borweins say that it may be
		the most efficient known algorithm for calculating pi. It has been used to set
		several world records.</P>

		HEIGHT="44" BORDER="0">Here is a formula by Srinivasa Ramanujan (1914). It
		converges rapidly, giving about 8 more digits of pi, every iteration.</P> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #12 (more series):</B></P> 
	 <P>Newton apparently used the following series (and the fact that the
		arcsin(1/2)=pi/6) to estimate pi:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>arcsin(x)=x+(1)(x^3)/(2)(3)+(1)(3)(x^5)/(2)(4)(5)+(1)(3)(5)(x^7)/(2)(4)(6)(7)+
		  . . .</P> 
		<P>pi/6=1/2+1/(2)(3)(2^3)+3/(2)(4)(5)(2^5)+(3)(5)/(2)(4)(6)(7)(2^7)+ . .
		  .</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P> With better notation, you don't need all those parentheses. Another
		series based on the arctangent series is:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>(pi^2)/18=1-1/(3)(3)+1/(3^2)(5)-1/(3^3)(7)+1/(3^4)(9)- . . .</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>And here is an infinite product:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>pi/2=2/1x2/3x4/3x4/5x6/5x6/7x . . .</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Here is my own series:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>pi /8=1/(1x3)+1/(5x7)+1/(9x11)+1/(13x15)+ . . .</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <HR>
	 
	 <P>Near the beginning of this article, I said that sqr(3)+sqr(2) is
		approximately pi. Well sqr(3)-sqr(2) is approximately 1/pi. Is that a
		coincidence? No, it turns out that sqr(3)-sqr(2)=1/(sqr(3)+sqr(2)). A little
		algebra turns the expression on the right into the one on the left.</P> <HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #13 (pi=3.14868804...?):</B></P> 
	 <P>I have received email from Peter J. Spencer who says that he can prove
		that pi=3.14868804... He has a formula, and has calculated it to 293 decimal
		places. He says that this has all been verified by a retired mathematics
		professor and a computer. Above (addendum #4), I use integral calculus to
		approximate pi, using thinner and thinner rectangles to approximate the area of
		a semicircle. Let's do that again:</P> 
	 <PRE>

  .00000001  3.14159263358948  3.14159267358948  3.14159265358948</PRE> 
	 <P>This time, while estimating pi, I have deduced lower and upper bounds on
		pi (much as Archimedes did). All of this could be done by hand, except that it
		would be very tedious to sum 100,000,000 small rectangles. So the process is
		not at all mysterious. I used an actual circle of radius 1. The area of each
		rectangle can be found to any accuracy needed. In each of the narrowest
		rectangles, the width is 0.00000001 and the height is calculated using the
		pythagorean theorem. Again, this can be calculated to any accuracy needed (as
		it is an exact formula). The lower bound is found by making the rectangles all
		fit within the unit semicircle. The upper bound is found by making the upper
		side just fit outside the unit semicircle (so the circle is inside the
		collection of rectangles).</P> 
	 <P> Here, I got fifteen digits of accuracy (which is the most accuracy that
		I can get out of this particular square root function). We can assume that the
		last digit may be somewhat inaccurate. I could print out a few square roots to
		verify this; but I won't. In the last row, we find that pi is between
		3.14159263358948 and 3.14159267358948. The value of pi given by Mr. Spencer,
		3.14868804..., is not in that range. That should convince anyone that his
		contention is false. No matter where he got his formula, it has nothing to do
		with circumferences or areas of circles.</P> 
	 <P>These formulas are the work of Mr. Spencer:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>pi=3z=C/d<BR> C=xy<SUP>7</SUP>z<SUP>2</SUP><BR>
		  d=xy<SUP>7</SUP>z/3<BR> C=10!<BR> x=4<BR> y=7<BR> z=360/7<SUP>3</SUP><BR>
		  pi=3628800/1152480=3.14868804...</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>He still contends that his "pi" is correct, and furthermore is rational
		(3628800/1152480 which reduces to 1080/343). A rational number is an integer
		divided by an integer (see <A HREF="../algebra/irration.htm">Irrational
		Numbers</A>).</P> 
	 <P>All this is a mystery to me. His pi is not pi. Euclid proved that C/d is
		the same for all circles. There are many ways to measure pi, using real circles
		(equations of circles), to any desired accuracy. Above, I have proved, using a
		real circle, that pi is within a fairly narrow range, and 3.14868804 . . . is
		not in that range.</P> <HR> 
	 <P>Of course, Mr. Spencer is still not convinced. Here is a little history
		about pi:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P> Archimedes conjectured (guessed) that pi is irrational. In 1761 (said
		  to be 1766 in some books), Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that pi is
		  irrational. And his proof is apparently very difficult. I have not seen the
		  proof. Legendre proved it in 1794. In 1947, Ivan Niven proved it fairly easily.
		  That proof is described in <I>Proofs from THE Book</I> (by M. Aigner and G.
		  Ziegler) as "an elegant one-page proof that needs only elementary calculus." It
		  also requires a couple more pages of proofs of preliminary theorems. Further
		  results from that proof are that pi squared is irrational, and that e^r is
		  irrational for every rational r not equal to zero. It has further been shown,
		  by Lindemann in 1882, that pi is transcendental number (in other words, it is
		  not the root of any polynomial equation with integer coefficients). The proof
		  of that is apparently very difficult indeed.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Above, Mr. Spencer gives z as pi/3. In email, he asks why people think
		that z is transcendental. Of course, no one has heard of z. They claim that pi
		is transcendental, which would mean that Mr. Spencer's z is also
		transcendental, <B>if the equation z=pi/3 were true</B>. Let's forget about
		"transcendental," as that is a difficult concept, and deal with "irrational."
		Pi is irrational. Therefore, z must be irrational, if z=pi/3 is true. Above, we
		see these equations:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> C=xy<SUP>7</SUP>z<SUP>2</SUP><BR> d=xy<SUP>7</SUP>z/3<BR>
		</BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>Mr. Spencer chooses C=10! (ten factorial). And he defines x=4 and y=7.
		Then he solves the first equation for z and finds that 3z=3.14868804 . . . and
		is rational. The second equation is not necessary, except to balance the 3z=C/d
		equation. Well, 3z is not pi, as I proved above. I actually proved that pi is
		between 3.14159263358948 and 3.14159267358948. 3z (3.14868804 . . .) is not
		equal to pi.</P><HR> 
	 <P>Mr. Spencer is still trying to convince me. I sent him this rather
		sarcastic (but accurate, in my opinion) summary of what he has done:</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>We want "pi" to be 1080/343 (or 3x360/7<SUP>3</SUP> or 3.14868804 . .
		  .) and not 3.1415926535 . . . Then we choose an integer (10! or 3628800) with
		  lots of factors as the circumference C of our circle. For no good reason, we
		  will define a z="pi"/3 and we find that 10!=(4)(7<SUP>7</SUP>)(z<SUP>2</SUP>).
		  We used 7<SUP>7</SUP> to cancel out the 7's in the denominator of
		  z<SUP>2</SUP>, since 7 is only a factor of 10! once. And who knows why we chose
		  z<SUP>2</SUP> instead of z? There is no pi<SUP>2</SUP> in C=(pi)d. Solving for
		  z, we find that it is (surprise!) 360/343. And therefore (surprise!)
		  "pi"=3.14868804 . . .</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>I told him that the above <B>IS</B> my understanding of his methods. He
		didn't seem to like the tone of the above. Anyway, this is all algebraic
		fiddling and has nothing whatsoever to do with a circle. We threw in 360 just
		to pretend that we might be dealing with a circle.</P><HR> 
	 <P><B>Addendum #14:</B></P> 
	 <P><IMG SRC="pi10.gif" ALT="area" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="657" HEIGHT="175"
		BORDER="0">On the far left we see a number of concentric circles, the largest

		to its original radius. It would seem that the triangle has the same area as
		the circle. This may be obvious or it may not be obvious. We can probably prove
		it using limits. Anyway, we see that the area of the triangle is
